# Picasso
 Xamarin Android binding for [Square Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) (A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android)
 
This project is baed on [this repo](https://github.com/mattleibow/square-bindings), I'm using Okio in my projects, so I'll keep this repo up to date with [original (_java_) repo](https://github.com/square/picasso).
 
 ## Usage
For now there is no Nuget package available, so you can download the `dll` file from `dist` folder, or clone the repo and build the solution and use the generated `dll`.

## Licenase
You need to pay 1000 million dollars for this or hit the __Star__ button :D
